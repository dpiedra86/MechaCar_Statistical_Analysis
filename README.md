# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
In this modules we learned R language which is similar to python but is much more focused into statistical analysis. This language mixes an useful set of lybraries such as plting libraries, json importing and anlytical calculations to create a complete analysisi while having the flexibility to perform dataset trasnformation to keep all in one. 

The interface is super useful while having a display for testing formulas, a terminal to see the outputs, an enviroment to track all variables, tables and objects in the file and a help screen that swithces according to the needs of the code called.

For this specific challenge we were asked to make calculations and anlyse the results for a prototype product developed by car company AutosRU's. Their painpoint comes into the production lines and want to understand better whats troubling the manufacturing team progress.
